Create a simple REST application for serving a blog.
It uses Spring Framework, Java 11, Lombok, blah blah.

Currently the application has 2 endpoints:
    
    1) To add a blog post
    2) To get a blog post by id
       
Your task is to add a commenting feature.

You should add two new endpoints.

    1) Post at /blog/post/{1}/comment - which should create a new comment for a post with passed {id}
    
    2) Get at /blog/post/{1}/comment - which should return all comments for a post with passed {id}

Comment fields:

DB yes provide config
Tests required give blank test class

Maybe we setup an interface they would have to implement?!?!?

You should not spend more than 4 hours on this task.
Feel free to modify existing files or create new files.  You can add some new dependencies if you choose.

Link to some resources for if they get stuck!?!
